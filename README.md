# Word Counter
_by David Mortkowitz_

*Description*
_A program that allows you to enter a keyword, then a sentence containing the chosen keyword, and it will output the number of keywords contained in the sentence._

## Word Counter Specs
_This program should allow someone to enter a word, then enter a sentence, and relay to the user how many times the word of their choice appears in the sentence they typed._

## Expected behavior examples

| Input Sentence                          | Input Word | Output |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- |
| dog                                     | dog        | 1      |
| The first dog ran after the second dog. | dog        | 2      |
---

_As the above example illustrates, it should count the word regardless of grammar or sentence length, given that it is an exact match (including matching capital letters) and the sentence is within a single string._
